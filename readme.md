# Service Worker Example  
  
try running the server and going to localhost:3000
```  
node index.js  
```  
  
you'll see the website,  
Inside console you'll see a message triggered by install event.  
close the server and go to localhost again,  
You'll see the website again even when the server is offline,  
because it was cached by service Worker.
